        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hey guys, I'm Timothy Mba. 
            <br>Apart from when it's time to get serious and real life work, I enjoy Racing, Swimming and working out.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have a background in real estate studies but decided to transition into tech when i discovered i 
            had a flare for coding due to how easy i found it to be (or so i thought) as opposed to the previous impression i had of it. 
            <br>When i wrote my first code of "HELLO WORLD" some months back, i felt this immediate rush within me that made me feel like i could conquer the world, but damn, this stuff isn't just a walkover. It requires discipline and constant practice while has taken a toll on me, but will i give up? NO!</p>
